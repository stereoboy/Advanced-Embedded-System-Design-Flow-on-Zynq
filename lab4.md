# Direct Memory Access using CDMA

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Enable a High Performance (HP) port of the processing system
* Add and connect the CDMA controller in the programmable logic
* Perform DMA operation between various memories

### Stereoboy's Comments
* Check out performance enhancement of using additional HW, CDMA instead of Zynq7.

## Steps
## Open the Project        
### Open the Vivado program. Open the _lab3_ project you created earlier or use the _lab3_ project from the labsolutions directory, and save the project as _lab4_.
1. Start Vivado if necessary and open either the lab3 project (lab3.xpr) you created earlier or the lab3 project in the labsolution directory using the **Open Project** link in the Getting Started page.
1. Select **File &gt; Project &gt; Save As …** to open the _Save Project As_ dialog box. Enter **lab4** as the project name.  Make sure that the _Create Project Subdirectory_ option is checked, the project directory path is **{labs}** and click **OK**.
1. This will create the lab4 directory and save the project and associated directory with lab4 name.
## Configure the Processor to Enable S\_AXI\_HP0 
### Open the Block Design and enable the S\_AXI\_HP0 interface
1. Click **Open Block Design** in the _Flow Navigator_ pane
1. Double-click on the _Zynq processing system_ instance to open its configuration form.
1. Select _PS-PL Configuration_ in the Page Navigator window in the left pane, expand _HP Slave AXI Interface_ on the right, and click on the check-box of the **S AXI HP0 Interface** to enable it, and click **OK** to close the Configuration window.
## Add CDMA and BRAM        
### Instantiate the AXI central DMA controller.
1. Click the ![alt tag](./images/add_ip.png) button and search for **Central** in the catalog.
1. Double-click the **AXI Central Direct Memory Access** to add an instance to the design.
1. Double-click on the _axi\_cdma\_0_ instance and uncheck the _Enable Scatter Gather_ option.
1. Change the _Write/Read Data Width_ to **64** and click **OK**.

    Note the burst size changes from 16 to 8. You can increase this up to 256 to improve the performance. Here we are using smallest number since the application allows small number of words transfer.

### Run connection automation

Connection automation could be run on all unconnected ports simultaneously. For the purposes of this lab, each port will be connected separately so that the changes made by the automation process are easier to follow.

1. Click on **Run Connection Automation** and select **processing\_system7\_0/S\_AXI\_HP0**
1. Check that this port will be connected to the _/axi\_cdma\_0/M\_AXI_ port and click **OK**.

## Conclusion

This lab led you through adding a CDMA controller to the PS so that you can perform DMA transfers between various memories. You used the high-performance port so DMA could be done between the BRAM residing in the PL section and DDR3 connected to the PS. You verified the design functionality by creating an application and executing it from the DDR3 memory.
