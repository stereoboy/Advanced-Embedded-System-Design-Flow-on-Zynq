# Profiling and Performance Tuning

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Setup the board support package (BSP) for profiling an application
* Set the necessary compiler directive on an application to enable profiling
* Setup the profiling parameters
* Profile an application and analyze the output

### Stereoboy's Comments
* Show How to use gprof by comparing PL HW implementation and PS SW implementation. (HW implementation is about twice faster than SW)

    </p>
    <p align = "center">
    <i>Source code snippet</i>
    </p>

     The function _fir\_software_( ) function is a software implementation of the FIR function. The _filter\_hw\_accel\_input_( ) function offloads the FIR function to the two FIR blocks that have been implemented in the PL.

## Run the Application and Profile
### Place the board into the JTAG boot up mode. Program the PL section and run the application using the user defined SW\_PROFILE symbol.
1. Place the board in the JTAG boot up mode.
1. Power ON the board.
1. Select **Xilinx &gt; Program FPGA** and click on **Program**.
1. Right click on the _lab6 directory_, and select **C/C++ Build Settings**.
    5.
1. Under the **ARM v7 gcc compiler** group, select the **Symbols** sub-group **,** click on the ![alt tag](./images/lab6/symbol.png) button to open the value entry form, enter **SW\_PROFILE** , and click **OK**.

    This will allow us to profile the software loop of the FIR application.

    <p align = "center">
    <i>Add user-defined symbol</i>
    </p>

1. Under the **ARM v7 gcc compiler** group, select the **Profiling** sub-group, then check the **Enable Profiling** box, and click **OK**.

    <p align="center">
    <img src ="./images/lab6/Fig8.png" width="60%" height="80%"/>
    </p>
    <p align = "center">
    <i>Compiler setting for enabling profiling</i>
    </p>

1. From the menu bar, Select **Run &gt; Run Configurations…** and double click on _Xilinx C/C++ application (System Debugger)_ to create a new configuration.
1. Click on the newly created **lab6 Debug** configuration, and select the **Application** tab.
1. Click on the _Advance Options_ **Edit…** button.
1. Click on the _Enable Profiling (gprof)_ check box, enter **100000** (100 kHz) in the Sampling Frequency field, enter **0x10000000** in the scratch memory address field, and click **OK**.

    <img src ="./images/lab6/Fig9.png" width="60%" height="80%"/>
    </p>
    <p align = "center">
    <i>Profiling options</i>
    </p>

1. Click **Apply** and then click the **Run** button to download the application and execute it.

    The program will run.

### Analyze the results.
1. When execution is completed, the Gmon File Viewer dialog box will appear showing _lab6.elf_ as the corresponding binary file.  Click **OK**.
1. Click on the **Sort samples per function** button (![alt tag](./images/lab6/FigSort.png))
).
1. Click in the **%Time** column to sort in the descending order.

    Note that the fir\_software routine is called 60 times, 22 samples were taken during the profiling, and on an average of 3.333 (PYNQ-Z1) or 3.666 (PYNQ-Z2/PYNQ-Z2)microseconds were spent per call.

    <img src ="./images/lab6/Fig10.png" width="60%" height="80%"/>
    </p>
    <p align = "center">
    <i>Sorting results</i>
    </p>

1. Go back to the _Run Configuration_, and change the sampling frequency to **1000000** (1 MHz) and profile the application again.
1. When execution is completed, click **OK** and the gprof viewer will be updated.
1. Invoke **gprof** , select the **Sorts samples per function** output, and sort the **%Time** column.

   Notice that the output has better resolution and reports more functions and more samples per function calls. Note that the number of calls to the fir\_software function has not changed but the number of samples taken increased, and the average time spent per call is 5.250 (PYNQ-Z1) or 5.016 (PYNQ-Z2) microseconds in the figure below.

    </p>

    At this stage, the designer of the system would decide if the FIR function should be ported to hardware.

### Profile the application using the hardware FIR filter IP by removing the user defined SW\_PROFILE symbol.
1. Select the _lab6_ application, right-click, and select **C/C++ Build Settings**.
1. Under the **ARM v7 gcc compiler** group, select the **Symbols** sub-group **,** select **SW\_PROFILE** , and delete it by clicking on the delete button.

    This will allow us to profile the hardware IP of the FIR application.

1. Click **Apply** , and then click **OK**
1. Select **Run &gt; Run Configurations** and click the **Run** button to profile the application again and click **OK** when profiling completes.

    Notice that the output now shows filter\_hw\_accel\_input function call instead of the fir\_software function call. Note that the average time spent per call is much less as the filtering is done in the hardware instead of the software.

1. Close the SDK and Vivado programs by selecting **File &gt; Exit** in each program.
1. Turn OFF the power on the board.

## Conclusion

This lab led you through enabling the software BSP and the application settings for the profiling.  You went through creating the hardware which included the hardware IP and was later profiled in the application.  You analyzed the profiled application output.
