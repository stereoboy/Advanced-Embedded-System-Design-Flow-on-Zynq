# Extending Memory Space with Block RAM

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Add BRAM and connect it to the processing system&#39;s AXI master port
* Execute the software application having data section in the BRAM

### Stereoboy's Comments
* DDR Base Clock 533 MHz, BRAM's Clock is 140 MHz in this lab. If setup for memory for Heap & Stack Segments changes DDR(**ps7\_ddr\_0**) -> BRAM(**axi\_bram\_ctrl\_0\_Mem0.**).

## Steps
## Open the Project        
### Open the Vivado program. Open the _lab1_ project you created earlier or use the _lab1_ project from the labsolution directory, and save the project as _lab3_.
1. Start Vivado if necessary and open either the _lab1_ project (lab1.xpr) you created earlier or the lab1 project in the _labsolutions_ directory using the **Open Project** link in the Getting Started page.
1. Select **File &gt; Project &gt; Save As …** to open the _Save Project As_ dialog box. Enter **lab3** as the project name.  Make sure that the _Create Project Subdirectory_ and _Import All Files to the New Project_ options are checked, the project directory path is **{labs}** and click **OK**.

    This will create the _lab3_ directory and save the project and associated directory with lab3 name.

## Conclusion

This lab led you through adding BRAM memory in the PL section thereby extending the total memory space available to the PS. You have verified the functionality by creating an application, targeting the stack and heap sections to the added BRAM, and executing the application.
