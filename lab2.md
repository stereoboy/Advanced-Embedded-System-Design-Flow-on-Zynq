# Debugging Using Hardware Analyzer

## Objectives 
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Add a VIO core in the design
* Use a VIO core to inject stimulus to the design and monitor the response
* Mark nets as debug so AXI transactions can be monitored
* Add an ILA core in Vivado
* Perform hardware debugging using the hardware analyzer
* Perform software debugging using the SDK

### Stereoboy's Comments
* Cross Trigger is... : if HW(Vivado) get triggerred -> SW(XSDK) triggered and if SW(XSDK) get triggered -> HW(Vivado) triggered. Break from one side causes break from the other side Bidirectionally
  * Use ILA (Integrated Logic Analyzer, not System ILA) with connection with Zynq PS.  
## Steps

## Open the Project
### Open the Vivado program. Open the lab1 project you created in the previous lab or use the lab1 project from the labsolution directory, and save the project as lab2. Set Project Settings to point to the IP repository provided in the sources directory.

1.  Start Vivado if necessary and open either the lab1 project (lab1.xpr) you created in the previous lab or the lab1 project in the labsolutions directory using the **Open Project** link in the Getting Started page.
1.  Select **File > Project > Save As …** to open the Save Project As dialog box. Enter lab2 as the project name.  Make sure that the Create Project Subdirectory option is checked, the project directory path is {labs} and click **OK.**
    This will create the lab2 directory and save the project and associated directory with lab2 name
1. Click **Settings** in the _Flow Navigator_ pane.
1. Expand **IP** in the left pane of the _Project Settings_ form and select **Repository.**
1. Click on the _plus_ button of the IP Repositories panel, browse to **{sources}\lab2\math_ip** and click **Select.**
    The directory will be scanned and one IP will be detected and reported.

1. Try a few other inputs and observe the outputs.
1. Once done, set the _vio\_0\_probe\_out0_ to **0** to isolate the vio interactions with the math\_ip core.
### Setup the ILA core (hw\_ila\_1) trigger condition to 0x2 for the PYNQ-Z1/PYNQ-Z2. Make sure that the switches on the board are not set at x3  (for PYNQ-Z1/PYNQ-Z2).  Set the trigger  equation to be ==, and arm the trigger. Click on the Resume button in the SDK to continue executing the program. Change the switches and observe that the hardware core triggers when the preset condition is met.
1. Select the **hw\_ila\_1** in the _Dashboard Options_ panel.
1. Add the LEDs to the _Basic Trigger Setup_, and set the trigger condition of the _hw\_ila\_1_ to trigger at LED output value equal to **0x5** for the PYNQ-Z1/PYNQ-Z2.

### Trigger the ILA and cause the software to halt
1. Click Step Over (F6) button twice to pass the current breakpoint
1. Arm the _hw\_ila\_1_ trigger
1. Resume the software (F8) until it enters the while loop
1. Verify it is executing by toggling the dip switches
1. In Vivado, arm the _hw\_ila\_1_ trigger
1. Press the push-buttons to 0x5, and notice that the application in SDK will break at some point (This point will be somewhere within the while loop)
1. Click on the **Resume** button

    The program will continue execution. Flip switches until it is _0x03_.

1. Click the Disconnect button (![alt tag](./images/disconnect.png)) in the SDK to terminate the execution.
1. Close the SDK by selecting **File &gt; Exit**.
1. Close the hardware session by selecting **File &gt; Close Hardware Manager**. Click **OK**.
1. Close Vivado program by selecting **File &gt; Exit**.
1. Turn OFF the power on the board.

## Conclusion

In this lab, you added a custom core with extra ports so you can debug the design using the VIO core. You instantiated the ILA and the VIO cores into the design. You used Mark Debug feature of Vivado to debug the AXI transactions on the custom peripheral. You then opened the hardware session from Vivado, setup various cores, and verified the design and core functionality using SDK and the hardware analyzer.
